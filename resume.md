## Industry Experience

### Altimetrik Pune | Senior Engineer | OCT 2024 – DEC 2024

**Brief Description:** - I was responsible for completing various miscellaneous tasks/projects that would come
up from Altimetrik's external clients as well as internal teams. Projects were mostly based on C, C++, FreeRTOS.

### Landis+Gyr Noida | Senior Firmware Development Engineer | May 2022 – OCT 2024

**Brief Description:** - I work on Wi-SUN (802.15) network standard where my team manages implementation
of various layers of the network stack, my expertise being in MAC layer timing synchronization and hardware
associated with said MAC layer implementation (RTC clock, crystal).
**Projects (C and Python, on EmbOS):**
● **Mac LAYER Time synchronization** between a Parent Router and a battery endpoint: Algorithms for
Child nodes being able to synchronize their clocks with Parent devices and maintain communication
with parent devices, take advantage of parent’s and battery endpoint’s schedule to send and receive
data packets back and forth and accounting for crystal drift in child nodes.
● **Calculated power usage of battery endpoints** and determine battery life of the device, identified
optimization scenarios and optimize the usage, achieved optimization from 11 years to 20 years
respectively through this activity.
● **Automate Power usage calculation in Battery endpoint** : Automation scripts to identify activity
occurring in any endpoint that uses battery above sleep current threshold and calculate power
consumed by leaving the device on for a few hours to record all possible events that could occur on
the endpoint.
● Worked on **optimization of various MAC layer communication** around battery endpoints such as
**Unicast** transmission and listening, **Broadcast** listening.
● Worked on identifying **drift on battery endpoints due to extreme temperature** and implemented
algorithms to compensate for that making the device withstand over 20C change in an hour and still
being able to communicate without using any extra power.

### SIEMENS PUNE | SOFTWARE ENGINEER/DEVELOPER | APRIL 2021 – April 2022

**Brief Description:** - I work in Railway automation Domain where our team manages the Interlocking code
for Railway trackside equipment which is written in ST-IEC 61131, ADA and C++. Interlocking code
manages how the trackside equipment behaves and signals incoming trains with respect to the position of
other trains running on tracks such that all the trains are signaled automatically to ensure smooth operation
of Railways.
**Projects (C, C++ 14 and Python, on Linux and Baremetal):**

- Tool (written in Python) to convert ST-IEC61131 code to CPP: This tool compiles the ST code to check
    for errors, if there were no errors it goes on to convert the code and all its modules line-byline to CPP
    then compiles it and executes it respectively for the specified target platfiorm.


### COLLABERA(Client:- Xilinx) HYDERABAD | CONTENT DEVELOPMENT ENGINEER | MARCH

### 2018 – APRIL 2021

**Brief Description:** - Lab development for training via ILT/On-demand. These labs include codes,
automation scripts and documentation that describe working of the product and core features with detailed
description and instructions on how to use those features. I work on Embedded systems-based labs i.e.
SoCs, Accelerator cards and FPGAs.
**Projects (C, C++, bash/shell and TCL on Baremetal, RTOS and Linux):**

- **Linux** – IPC mechanisms, Boot and configuration of Linux kernel for Zynq7000 and Zynq US+ SoCs
    (ARM based)
- **Low speed peripherals (standalone) –** Configuration and usage of all low-speed peripherals
    present on the SoC like **I2C, SPI, UART**
- **PMU (platform management unit) -** Adding custom modules to the PMU firmware to facilitate extra
    functionality, Managing power on individual processor cores
- **FSBL -** Debugging on MPSoC, Add/remove functionality to enable emulation on QEMU for certain
    platforms
- **FreeRTOS –** Producer/Consumer concept and it’s various use cases

**Development of Scripts that automate creation of unattended Virtual Machines running Linux and
various Xilinx tools along with other dependencies and various automation scripts and builder
scripts to facilitate assistance in labs**
