# Landgen Development Progress Log

## 📋 Project Overview
Development of a command-line tool `landgen` to generate HTML landing pages from markdown resume files, matching the structure and styling of an existing `index.html` portfolio template.

## 🎯 Session Summary (September 28, 2025)

### Development Approach
- ✅ Debugging-first methodology with targeted debug scripts
### Major Issues Identified and Resolved

#### 1. Experience Section Structure Issues ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Experience sections were mixing Brief Description content with Projects content instead of separating them into proper timeline structure.

**Root Cause**: Template was trying to split content using text patterns instead of structured parsing.

**Solution**: 
- Enhanced `ResumeParser` with dedicated `_process_experience_section()` method
- Implemented proper job parsing with structured "Brief Description" and "Projects" separation
- Updated template to use timeline-projects structure matching original `index.html`

**Files Modified**:
- `src/landgen/parser/resume_parser.py` - Added experience processing logic
- `src/landgen/templates/resume.html` - Updated timeline-projects template structure

#### 2. Skills Section Parsing Bug ✅ FIXED  
**Problem**: Skills section content was completely lost during parsing, showing empty content despite raw data being present.

**Root Cause**: Parser was only handling `-` bullet points but resume.md used `·` (bullet) characters.

**Solution**:
- Initially added support for both `-` and `·` bullet characters
- Standardized on `-` bullets per user preference
- Enhanced parser with multi-line bullet support for content spanning multiple lines
- Improved list generation to create unified `<ul>` structures instead of separate lists

**Technical Details**:
- Added `current_bullet_content` tracking for multi-line bullets
- Enhanced empty line handling to properly close and continue lists
- Special handling for Skills sections to maintain unified list structure

**Files Modified**:
- `src/landgen/parser/resume_parser.py` - Enhanced bullet processing logic
- `resume.md` - Converted all `·` bullets to `-` bullets

#### 3. Areas of Interest Display Issues ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Areas of interest section showing HTML-escaped content (`&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;`) instead of proper formatted list.

**Root Cause**: Parser was converting content to HTML format, but template expected plain text for comma-splitting.

**Solution**:
- Added special handling in parser to keep "Areas of interest" as raw text
- Updated template to properly process comma-separated interests
- Initially implemented content-based Font Awesome icons, then switched to generic icons for flexibility

**Technical Details**:
- Modified `_save_section()` method to detect interest sections
- Enhanced template logic to remove bullet markers and split by commas
- Implemented generic `fas fa-circle` icons for universal compatibility

**Files Modified**:
- `src/landgen/parser/resume_parser.py` - Added special interest section handling
- `src/landgen/templates/resume.html` - Enhanced interest processing logic

### Current Status

#### ✅ Completed Features
1. **Experience Structure**: Proper Brief Description and Projects separation
2. **Skills Section**: Multi-line bullet support with unified list display
3. **Areas of Interest**: Generic icon-based display with comma-separated processing
4. **Template Matching**: Generated HTML matches original `index.html` structure
5. **Multi-line Content**: Robust handling of content spanning multiple lines
6. **Generic Compatibility**: Template works with various user content types

#### 🔄 Known Remaining Issues
1. **Education Section**: Needs removal from template
2. **Publications Section**: Needs removal from template  
3. **Get in Touch Section**: Needs formatting fixes to match `index.html`

### File Structure Changes

#### New Files Created
- `debug_skills.py` - Skills section debugging utility
- `debug_areas.py` - Areas of interest debugging utility
- `progress_log.md` - This comprehensive progress documentation

#### Modified Files
- `src/landgen/parser/resume_parser.py` - Major parsing enhancements
- `src/landgen/templates/resume.html` - Template structure improvements
- `resume.md` - Standardized bullet formatting

### Additional Template Fixes (Completed)

#### 4. Education & Publications Section Removal ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Template was displaying Education and Publications sections that weren't needed for landing page format.

**Solution**: 
- Removed the generic sections loop that rendered any sections not explicitly handled
- Clean landing page now focuses only on key professional information

**Files Modified**:
- `src/landgen/templates/resume.html` - Removed generic sections loop

#### 5. Get In Touch Section Structure ✅ FIXED  
**Problem**: Contact section structure didn't match original `index.html` design and styling.

**Solution**:
- Updated to match original structure with proper `contact-info` and `contact-methods`
- Added "Let's Connect" heading and descriptive text
- Implemented proper `contact-method` styling with `method-label` and `method-value`
- Fixed GitHub URL parsing to display username only

**Files Modified**:
- `src/landgen/templates/resume.html` - Complete contact section restructure

### Template Documentation Synchronization (Completed)

#### 6. Template Documentation Updates ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Template documentation (resume.md, RESUME_TEMPLATE.md, README.md) included Education and Publications sections that are no longer parsed by the system.

**Solution**:
- Removed Education and Publications sections from `resume.md` (801 lines reduced to clean format)
- Updated `RESUME_TEMPLATE.md` to document only parsed sections (Areas of Interest, Industry Experience, Skills)
- Simplified Skills section specification from "Skills & Abilities (Years of Experience)" to "Skills"
- Standardized bullet format from `·` to `-` throughout all documentation
- Updated README.md example to show actual template structure users should follow
- Removed references to unused subsection headings (### TECHNICAL)

**Technical Details**:
- Parser-template alignment: Documentation now matches parser capabilities exactly
- User clarity: Template shows only what will be parsed and displayed
- Maintenance improvement: Eliminated confusion between documented and actual functionality

**Files Modified**:
- `resume.md` - Removed unused sections, clean professional format
- `RESUME_TEMPLATE.md` - Complete specification overhaul to match parser
- `README.md` - Updated examples and section references

2. **Areas of Interest** - Comma-separated with generic Font Awesome icons
3. **Industry Experience** - Structured job parsing with timeline-projects separation
4. **Skills** - Multi-line bullet support with unified list generation

**Documentation Accuracy:**
